## Ted Nelson

A tad (little) crazy, but has some very interesting ideas.

## All "new" Star Wars movies

I admit I was a pretty big star wars fan as a child. I would watch and re-watch them.
Yet, all ( yeah, even rouge one) the new star wars movies are boring and don't get rewatched. Why? I will leave this unanswered

I have not seen the Solo (solo) movie. I am not holding my breath.
